# Clipboard Sharing Alternative

Since iOS Share Extensions require native code setup, here's a simpler alternative that works immediately:

## How to Add Products from Safari

### Method 1: Copy & Paste (Works Now)
1. Browse to a product page in Safari
2. Tap and hold the URL bar
3. Select "Copy"
4. Open VirtualFit app
5. Go to Wardrobe tab
6. Paste the URL in the "Paste Product URL" field
7. Add a name and tap "Add to Wardrobe"

### Method 2: Share Extension (Requires Setup)
Follow the instructions in SHARE_EXTENSION_SETUP.md to enable sharing directly from Safari's share sheet.

## Tips
